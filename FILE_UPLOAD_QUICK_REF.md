# SharePoint Document Upload Feature - Quick Reference

## Overview
Complete implementation of SharePoint-based document upload system with Weaviate-DB integration for IdeaGraph v1.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Tab Renamed ✅
- "Similar Items" → "Files" in item detail view

### 2. File Upload System ✅
- Upload files up to 25 MB
- Support for 20+ file formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX, code files)
- Automatic storage in SharePoint: `IdeaGraph/{normalized_item_title}/`
- Smart folder name normalization (removes special characters)

### 3. Weaviate Integration ✅
- Text extraction from supported formats
- Intelligent chunking (50k chars/chunk)
- Storage as KnowledgeObject with mapping:
  - title = filename
  - description = file content
  - type = "File"
  - url = SharePoint download URL
  - owner, section, status, tags from item

### 4. File Management ✅
- List all uploaded files
- Download via SharePoint URL
- Delete with complete cleanup (SharePoint + Weaviate + Database)

### 5. UI Implementation ✅
- Upload button in Files tab
- Progress indicator during upload
- File list table with:
  - Filename, size, uploader, date
  - Weaviate sync status badge
  - Download and delete actions

## Files Modified/Created

### New Services:
- `core/services/file_extraction_service.py` (300+ lines)
- `core/services/item_file_service.py` (450+ lines)

### New Tests:
- `main/test_file_upload.py` (17 tests, all passing)

### Modified:
- `main/models.py` (ItemFile model)
- `main/api_views.py` (4 new endpoints)
- `main/urls.py` (4 new routes)
- `main/templates/main/items/detail.html` (UI updates)
- `requirements.txt` (PyPDF2, python-docx)

### Documentation:
- `DOKUMENTEN_UPLOAD_FEATURE.md` (complete guide in German)

## API Endpoints

```
POST   /api/items/<item_id>/files/upload    - Upload file
GET    /api/items/<item_id>/files           - List files
GET    /api/files/<file_id>                 - Get download URL
DELETE /api/files/<file_id>/delete          - Delete file
```

## Configuration Required

In Django Settings model:
- `graph_api_enabled = True`
- `client_id` (Microsoft App)
- `client_secret` (Microsoft App)
- `tenant_id` (Microsoft)
- `sharepoint_site_id` (Target SharePoint site)

## Security

✅ All checks passed:
- CodeQL: No vulnerabilities
- Dependencies: No CVEs
- Input validation
- Permission checks
- CSRF protection
- File size limits (25MB)

## Test Results

```
17 tests - ALL PASSING ✅

FileExtractionService: 12 tests
- Format detection
- Text extraction
- Encoding handling
- Size validation
- Chunking logic

ItemFileService: 2 tests
- Folder normalization
- Upload validation

ItemFile Model: 3 tests
- CRUD operations
- Relationships
- Cascade deletion
```

## Usage Example

```python
# Upload a file
service = ItemFileService()
result = service.upload_file(
    item=item,
    file_content=file_bytes,
    filename="document.pdf",
    content_type="application/pdf",
    user=current_user
)

# List files
files = service.list_files(item_id)

# Delete a file
service.delete_file(file_id, current_user)
```

## Supported File Types

**Text Files**: .txt, .md
**Code Files**: .py, .cs, .js, .java, .c, .cpp, .h, .html, .css, .json, .xml, .yaml, .yml, .sh, .sql, .r, .rb, .go, .php, .swift, .kt, .ts, .tsx, .jsx, .vue
**Documents**: .pdf, .docx

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Configure SharePoint settings in Django admin
4. Test upload functionality in UI
5. Verify Weaviate synchronization

## Known Limitations

- Files must be ≤ 25 MB
- Large file upload (>25MB) not supported yet
- Chunking limited to 50k characters per chunk
- PDF/DOCX extraction requires additional libraries

## Future Enhancements

- Support for larger files with resumable uploads
- More file formats (XLSX, PPTX)
- File versioning
- Preview functionality
- Full-text search across all files
- Auto-tagging based on content
