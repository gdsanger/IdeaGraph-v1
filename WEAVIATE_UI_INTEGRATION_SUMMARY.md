## API Integration

### JavaScript Fetch Calls
Both pages use JavaScript to call the backend API endpoints:

- JSON response handling
- Error propagation to UI
- Loading states management
- Response formatting

## Design & Styling

### Theme
- Dark theme with IdeaGraph corporate identity
- Primary Amber (#E49A28) for accent colors

- Graph Gray (#1A1A1A) backgrounds
- Soft White (#EAEAEA) text

### Components
- Bootstrap 5 cards
- Bootstrap Icons
- Responsive grid layout (col-lg, col-md, col-sm)
- Fade-in animations with delays
- Hover effects on buttons
- Badge components for counts
- Alert components for messages

### Accessibility

## Security

### Access Control

### API Security
