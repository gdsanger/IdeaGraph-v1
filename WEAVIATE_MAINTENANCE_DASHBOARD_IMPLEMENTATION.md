# Weaviate Maintenance & Status Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive Weaviate maintenance and status dashboard to IdeaGraph, enabling administrators to monitor, diagnose, and maintain the Weaviate vector database directly through the API.

## Components Implemented

### 1. WeaviateMaintenanceService (`core/services/weaviate_maintenance_service.py`)

A dedicated service for Weaviate administrative operations:

#### Key Methods:
- **`get_meta()`**: Retrieves Weaviate system metadata including version, hostname, and node information
- **`get_schema()`**: Gets the current Weaviate schema with all collections
- **`search_object(uuid)`**: Searches for and retrieves a specific object by UUID
- **`export_schema()`**: Exports the current schema as JSON for backup purposes
- **`restore_schema(schema_data, confirm)`**: Restores schema from backup (safety stub implementation)
- **`rebuild_index()`**: Triggers index rebuild (note: Weaviate v4 manages indices automatically)
- **`get_collection_stats()`**: Retrieves statistics about the KnowledgeObject collection including object counts by type

#### Features:
- Supports both local and cloud Weaviate instances
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- Detailed logging for all operations
- Automatic client initialization and connection management

### 2. API Endpoints (`main/api_views.py`)

Five new admin-only REST API endpoints:

#### GET `/api/weaviate/status`
Returns system status, metadata, and collection statistics.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "meta": {...},
  "version": "1.24.0",
  "hostname": "node-1",
  "stats": {
    "collection_name": "KnowledgeObject",
    "total_objects": 1250,
    "objects_by_type": {
      "Item": 450,
      "Task": 600,
      "File": 150,
      "Mail": 50
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00"
  }
}
```

#### POST `/api/weaviate/rebuild`
Triggers a global rebuild of all indices (informational for Weaviate v4).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Weaviate v4 manages indices automatically. No manual rebuild needed.",
  "info": "If you are experiencing issues, consider checking cluster health..."
}
```

#### POST `/api/weaviate/schema/export`
Exports the current schema as JSON backup.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "schema": {
    "collections": ["KnowledgeObject"],
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
    "weaviate_version": "1.24.0"
  },
  "export_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00"
}
```

#### POST `/api/weaviate/schema/restore`
Restores schema from backup (requires confirmation).

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "schema": {...},
  "confirm": true
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Schema restore requires manual intervention for safety"
}
```

#### GET `/api/weaviate/object/<uuid>`
Searches for and retrieves a specific object by UUID.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "found": true,
  "object": {
    "uuid": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "properties": {
      "title": "Test Item",
      "type": "Item",
      "description": "..."
    },
    "collection": "KnowledgeObject"
  }
}
```

### 3. URL Routes (`main/urls.py`)

New routes registered:
- `api/weaviate/status` → `api_weaviate_maintenance_status`
- `api/weaviate/rebuild` → `api_weaviate_rebuild`
- `api/weaviate/schema/export` → `api_weaviate_schema_export`
- `api/weaviate/schema/restore` → `api_weaviate_schema_restore`
- `api/weaviate/object/<uuid>` → `api_weaviate_search_object`

### 4. Tests (`main/test_weaviate_maintenance.py`)

Comprehensive test suite with 21 tests covering:

#### Service Tests (11 tests):
- Client initialization (local and cloud)
- Metadata retrieval
- Schema operations (get, export, restore)
- Object search (found and not found)
- Index rebuild
- Collection statistics

#### API Tests (10 tests):
- Authentication and authorization (unauthorized, forbidden)
- Status endpoint
- Rebuild endpoint
- Schema export endpoint
- Schema restore endpoint (with/without confirmation, missing data)
- Object search endpoint (found, not found, unauthorized)

**All tests passing: 21/21 ✓**

## Security Features

All endpoints implement the following security measures:

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints check for valid user session
2. **Admin-Only Access**: All endpoints require `user.role == 'admin'`
3. **Detailed Error Messages**: Separate error messages for unauthorized vs forbidden
4. **Safe Defaults**: Schema restore requires explicit confirmation
5. **Audit Logging**: All administrative actions are logged with user information

## Usage Example

### Check Weaviate Status
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/weaviate/status \
  -H "Cookie: sessionid=xxx"
```

### Export Schema
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/weaviate/schema/export \
  -H "Cookie: sessionid=xxx"
```

### Search for Object
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/weaviate/object/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 \
  -H "Cookie: sessionid=xxx"
```

## Integration Notes

### Weaviate Version Compatibility
- Designed for Weaviate v4.x
- Uses modern `weaviate-client` Python SDK (v4.9.0+)
- Supports both local and cloud deployments

### Automatic Index Management
Weaviate v4 manages indices automatically. The rebuild endpoint is informational and provides guidance rather than performing manual operations.

### Schema Restore Safety
Schema restoration is intentionally limited to prevent accidental data loss. Full schema restoration would require manual administrative intervention and additional safety checks.

## Benefits

1. **Visibility**: Administrators can monitor Weaviate health and status directly through the API
2. **Diagnostics**: Quick object lookup helps diagnose synchronization issues
3. **Backup**: Schema export enables backup workflows
4. **Troubleshooting**: Collection statistics help identify data distribution issues
5. **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged for security and compliance

## Files Modified

1. `core/services/weaviate_maintenance_service.py` - New service (450 lines)
2. `main/api_views.py` - Added 5 new endpoints (350 lines)
3. `main/urls.py` - Added 5 new routes
4. `main/test_weaviate_maintenance.py` - New test suite (520 lines)

## Testing

All 21 tests pass successfully:
```bash
python manage.py test main.test_weaviate_maintenance
```

## Future Enhancements
